# ProjectArduino
 

Bimonthly project for Computer Architecture and Organization II. The project's idea is to control a remote control cart, but its control was developed to be used by cell phone over a Wi-Fi network.

For the project's success an Asp32, an H bridge and a Powerbank were used for its power supply.

Besides controlling by cell phone, headlights were added and can be activated by the control on your cell phone.
